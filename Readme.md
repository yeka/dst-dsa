# Don't Starve Together - Dedicated Server Administration

Don't Starve Together - Dedicated Server Administration (DST-DSA) is a web interface to manage dedicated server.
It aims to make dedicated server setup a lot easier and gives a Web User Interface to manage your worlds (mods included).

# Web User Interface features

[ ] Cluster Token collection (at the moment, I think that more cluster token is needed if you want to run more than one world. Need to double check on that.)
[ ] Server mods collections
[ ] World creation and mod activation
[ ] Start/Stop World and World status
[ ] World Chat Log
[ ] Administrator Password
